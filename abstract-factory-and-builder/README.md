This purpose of this project is to argue for a functional approach to design using composition in place of the classical
object oriented Design Patterns.

The functional/composition approach has the following advantages:

* less code = less complexity - the OOP version totals 205 lines of javascript code, while the "JS" version is only
102 lines of code. 205 lines may not sound like that many - and a difference of 103 lines doesn't seem very
great; however, as you begin to scale, you start looking more at percentages - and the JS version
comes in at just under 50% of the size of the OOP version.

* "start today" - the on-boarding process for legacy code can be very high - expecting new-hires to nimbly
traverse a complex mesh of design patterns is unreasonable. OTOH, if the code is simple, an employee can begin
making changes on her or his first day at work.

* familiarity - choosing a technology (such as Javascript) that is familiar to a great many people has distinct
advantages - so, too, does steering clear of design methodologies (such as GoF patterns) that takes many years of
experience to learn well. The "Javascript" version of this project could be easily extended and maintained by a new
college graduate, or even by a teenage programming enthusiast.
